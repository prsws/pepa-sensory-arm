"""Integration tests for graceful degradation when optional components are unavailable.

This test suite verifies that the Pepa Sensory Arm system continues to work when optional
components fail or are unavailable. Each test mocks a component failure and verifies:
1. The agent still initializes successfully
2. Core functionality (basic conversation) still works
3. Appropriate warnings/logs are generated
4. The system operates in a degraded but functional mode
