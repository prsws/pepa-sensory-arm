"""Unit tests for memory quality validation.

Tests the enhanced validation logic that rejects low-quality memories including:
- Meta-information about conversations
- Negative existence statements
- Content that is too short
- Content with low importance scores
- Transient states and low-value patterns

These tests validate both positive cases (good memories that should be stored)
and negative cases (low-quality memories that should be rejected).
