## Usage Examples

### Voice Control

```yaml
# Use with Home Assistant voice assistant
# Just speak naturally to your voice assistant
"Turn on the kitchen lights to 50%"
"What's the temperature in the living room?"
"Is the front door locked?"
```

### Automation Integration

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Morning Briefing"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "07:00:00"
    action:
      - service: home_agent.process
        data:
          text: "Good morning! Please prepare for the day."
          conversation_id: "morning_routine"
```

### Custom Tool Example

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
home_agent:
  tools_custom:
    - name: check_weather
      description: "Get weather forecast"
      handler:
        type: rest
        url: "https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast"
        method: GET
        query_params:
          latitude: "47.6062"
          longitude: "-122.3321"
          current: "temperature_2m,precipitation"
```

**For more examples, see [Examples Documentation](docs/EXAMPLES.md)**

## Voice Conversation Persistence

Home Agent automatically maintains conversation context across multiple voice interactions, enabling natural multi-turn conversations with your voice assistant.

### How It Works

- Each user/device combination maintains a persistent conversation session
- Sessions automatically expire after 1 hour of inactivity (configurable)
- Conversation history is preserved within each session
- Different devices maintain independent conversation contexts

### Example

**Before (without persistence):**
```
User: "What's the temperature in the living room?"
Agent: "The living room is 72°F"

[Later]
User: "What about the bedroom?"
Agent: "I don't have context about what you're asking about"
```

**After (with persistence):**
```
User: "What's the temperature in the living room?"
Agent: "The living room is 72°F"

[Later]
User: "What about the bedroom?"
Agent: "The bedroom temperature is 68°F"
```

### Configuration

Configure the session timeout in integration settings:
- Minimum: 60 seconds (1 minute)
- Maximum: 86400 seconds (24 hours)
- Default: 3600 seconds (1 hour)

### Clearing Conversations

Reset your conversation context using the `clear_conversation` service:

```yaml
# Clear conversation for current user/device
service: home_agent.clear_conversation

# Clear conversation for specific device
service: home_agent.clear_conversation
data:
  device_id: "kitchen_satellite"

# Clear all conversations
service: home_agent.clear_conversation
```

### Multi-Device Behavior

Each device maintains its own conversation context:
- Kitchen satellite remembers kitchen-related conversations
- Bedroom satellite has independent context
- Same user on different devices = different conversations
