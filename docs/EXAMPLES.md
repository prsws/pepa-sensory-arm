        required:
          - location
      handler:
        type: rest
        url: "https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast"
        method: GET
        query_params:
          latitude: "47.6788491"
          longitude: "-122.3971093"
          forecast_days: 3
          current: "temperature_2m,precipitation"
```

**Usage:** "What's the weather like?"

### Service Trigger Tool

Trigger Home Assistant automations and scripts.

```yaml
pepa_sensory_arm:
  tools_custom:
    - name: run_morning_routine
      description: "Trigger the morning routine automation"
      handler:
        type: service
        service: automation.trigger
        data:
          entity_id: automation.morning_routine

    - name: notify_family
      description: "Send notification to family members"
      parameters:
        type: object
        properties:
          message:
            type: string
        required:
          - message
      handler:
        type: service
        service: notify.family
        data:
          message: "{{ message }}"
```

**Usage:** "Run the morning routine" or "Tell everyone dinner is ready"

## Automation Examples

### Trigger on Tool Execution

Log or react when specific tools are executed.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Log Device Control Events"
    trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: pepa_sensory_arm.tool.executed
        event_data:
          tool_name: ha_control
    condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: "{{ trigger.event.data.success }}"
    action:
      - service: logbook.log
        data:
          name: Pepa Sensory Arm
          message: >
            Controlled {{ trigger.event.data.parameters.entity_id }}
            via voice: {{ trigger.event.data.parameters.action }}
```

### Smart Morning Routine

Context-aware routine with memory and custom tools.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Smart Morning Routine"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "07:00:00"
    action:
      - service: pepa_sensory_arm.process
        data:
          text: >
            Good morning! Please prepare for the day based on my preferences,
            today's weather, and calendar events.
          conversation_id: morning_routine
```

**What Happens:**
1. Recalls user preferences from memory (e.g., bedroom temperature)
2. Checks weather via custom tool
3. Reviews calendar for events
4. Executes personalized routine

## Memory System Examples

### Automatic Memory Extraction

Memories are automatically extracted after conversations.

```yaml
# Settings > Pepa Sensory Arm > Configure > Memory System
Memory Enabled: true
Automatic Extraction: true
Extraction LLM: external
Max Memories: 100
```

**Example:**
```
User: "I really like the living room warm in the evenings, around 72 degrees"
Assistant: "I'll keep the living room at 72 degrees in the evenings. Got it!"

[Memory stored automatically]
Type: preference
Content: "User prefers living room at 72°F in the evenings"

[Later]
User: "Set the living room for the evening"
Assistant: "Setting living room to 72 degrees, as you prefer for evenings."
```

### Manual Memory Storage

Explicitly store information during conversation.

```
User: "Remember that I'm allergic to pollen"
Assistant: [Calls store_memory tool]
"I've made a note that you're allergic to pollen."

[Later]
User: "Should I open the windows?"
Assistant: "The pollen count is high today. Since you're allergic to pollen,
I'd recommend keeping windows closed and using air conditioning instead."
```

## Multi-LLM Examples

### Local Model + GPT-4 for Analysis

Use a fast local model for control and delegate complex analysis to GPT-4.

```yaml
# Primary LLM (Local Ollama)
LLM Base URL: http://localhost:11434/v1
Model: llama2:13b
Temperature: 0.5
Max Tokens: 300

# External LLM (GPT-4)
External LLM Enabled: true
External LLM Base URL: https://api.openai.com/v1
External LLM API Key: sk-your-api-key
External LLM Model: gpt-4o
Temperature: 0.8
Max Tokens: 1000
```

**Example Workflow:**
```
User: "Analyze my energy usage this week and suggest optimizations"

Primary LLM (Ollama):
  1. Calls ha_query to get energy data
  2. Recognizes this needs complex analysis
  3. Calls query_external_llm with data

External LLM (GPT-4):
  - Performs detailed analysis
  - Identifies patterns and anomalies
  - Provides specific recommendations

Primary LLM:
  - Returns formatted response to user
```

**Cost Optimization:** Simple queries handled by free local model; complex analysis only calls paid GPT-4 when needed. Typical ratio: 80% local, 20% external.

### Cost Optimization Strategy

Minimize API costs while maintaining functionality.

```yaml
# Customize external LLM tool description
External LLM Tool Description: |
  Use this tool ONLY for:
  - Detailed multi-step analysis
  - Recommendations requiring complex reasoning
  - Creative suggestions (naming, organizing)

  Do NOT use for:
  - Simple device control
  - Status queries
  - Quick calculations

# Use cheaper models
Model: gpt-4o-mini  # Primary
External LLM Model: gpt-4o  # Only when needed

# Reduce token limits
Max Tokens: 200  # Primary
External Max Tokens: 500  # External
```
